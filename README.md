The [MYSC-01 kit](http://abopen.com/MYSC-01) is a simple but elegant case based on the "[sick of beige](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Sick_of_Beige_basic_case_v1)" design to aid with breadboard prototyping and work with the myStorm FPGA board. It can be bought from [Ground Electronics](http://groundelectronics.com).

## Repository contents

The case design is provided in the following formats:

* Inkscape SVG (source)
* PDF
* DXF

The top and bottom panels are laser cut from 3mm acrylic.
